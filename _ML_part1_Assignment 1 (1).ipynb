    "1) Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "ANS:Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. AI encompasses various techniques, including machine learning and deep learning, to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can learn from data, adapt to new inputs, and perform tasks autonomously.\n",

    "Example: Personal Assistant Apps like Siri or Google Assistant are prime examples of AI. These applications use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries, machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy over time based on user interactions, and various other AI techniques to provide personalized assistance.\n",

    "ANS:Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Training Set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** This is the largest portion of your dataset and is used to **train the model**. The model learns from the patterns and relationships in the training data, adjusting its internal parameters to make predictions.\n",
    "* **Importance:**\n",
    "    * Provides the foundation for your model's learning.\n",
    "    * Should be large enough to represent the diversity of your real-world data.\n",
    "    * Insufficient training data can lead to underfitting (model fails to learn general patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Validation Set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** This **acts as a checkpoint** during the training process. After each training iteration (epoch), the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set.\n",
    "* **Importance:**\n",
    "    * Helps prevent **overfitting** (model memorizes training data but performs poorly on unseen data).\n",
    "    * Used to tune hyperparameters (internal settings) of the model to optimize performance.\n",
    "    * Catches issues early, saving time and resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Identifying Deviations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unsupervised algorithms learn the underlying patterns and distributions in the data.\n",
    "* Deviations from these learned patterns, such as data points significantly far from the expected range, are flagged as potential anomalies.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Clustering:** Group data points with similar characteristics. Deviations fall outside established clusters and get flagged.\n",
    "* **Density-based methods:** Identify regions of high data density and consider points far from these dense regions as anomalies.\n",
    "* **Isolation Forest:** Randomly partitions data points and isolates anomalies faster than normal data based on the number of splits needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doesn't require labelled data, which can be scarce or expensive for anomaly detection.\n",
    "* Useful for detecting novel, unseen anomalies not present in training data.\n",
    "* Can handle continuous and categorical data.\n",

    "**4. Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Setting a threshold for flagging anomalies can be challenging, requiring domain knowledge and careful tuning.\n",
    "* May not be suitable for detecting specific types of anomalies with subtle deviations.\n",
